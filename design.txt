given schema with all the attributes:
-------------------------------------

Other(ItemID, Name, Category, Currently, BuyPrice, FirstBid, NumberOfBids, Bids-details, 
Location, Country, Started, Ends, Seller-details, Description)

Bids-details and Seller-details represent all the information related to Bids and 
the user selling the item respectively.

Following are the functional dependencies in the schema:
ItemID -> Name, Description, SellerUserID, Started, Ends, BuyPrice, FirstBid, 
ItemID -> Currently, Number_of_Bids
UserID -> Location, Country, Rating

Following are the multi-valiued dependencies in the schema:
ItemID ->> Category
ItemID ->> BidderUserID, Time, Amount

=============
Decomposition:
=============

Step1:
-----
Since ItemID is MVD on Category, we need to separate out the Category attribute 
from the big table; otherwise, we repeat the information of other attributes 
in the table.

Applying "ItemID ->> Category" for decomposition,

ItemCategory(ItemID, Category)
Other(ItemID, Name, Currently, BuyPrice, FirstBid, NumberOfBids, Bids-details, 
Location, Country, Rating, Started, Ends, Seller-details, Description)

Step2:
-----

Seller-details contain all the information of the user. Multiple items can 
have the same seller. Therefore, we repeat the seller information if the same 
seller sells multiple items.

Applying "UserID -> Location, Country, Rating" for decomposition,

ItemCategory(ItemID, Category)
UserInfo(UserID, Location, Country, Rating)
Other(ItemID, Name, Currently, BuyPrice, FirstBid, NumberOfBids, Bids-details, 
Started, Ends, SellerUserID, Description)

Step3:
-----
An item can have multiple bids. In this case, the 'Bids-details' will make the 
rest of the information in the 'Other' table repeated. So, the details of 
the bids needs to be sepearated out.

Applying "ItemID ->> BidderUserID, Time, Amount" for decomposition,

ItemCategory(ItemID, Category)
UserInfo(UserID, Location, Country, Rating)
BidderInfo(ItemID, BidderUserID, Time, Amount)
ItemInfo(ItemID, Name, Currently, BuyPrice, FirstBid, NumberOfBids, Started, Ends, SellerUserID, Description)

Step4:
-----
There is an update anomoly inside the ItemInfo table. When a bid information is added, 
the 'Currently' and the 'NumberOfBids' are updated but not the other values.
So, I felt it is inefficient to touch the ItemInfo table (which is the largest), 
and so separated out the 'Currently' and the 'NumberOfBids' information into a 
different table.

FINAL TABLE:

ItemCategory(ItemID, Category)
UserInfo(UserID, Location, Country, Rating)
BiddInfo(ItemID, Currently, NumberOfBids)
BidderInfo(ItemID, BidderUserID, Time, Amount)
ItemInfo(ItemID, Name, BuyPrice, FirstBid, Started, Ends, SellerUserID, Description)
